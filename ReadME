This project is a Maze Solver and Visualizer that combines the power of C for algorithmic maze solving and web technologies (HTML, CSS, JS) for intuitive visualization.

ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
Given a maze represented as a 2D grid with:

. for paths (walkable),

# or other characters for walls (non-walkable),

The goal is to:

*** Find a path from a start point to an end point using Breadth-First Search (BFS),

*** Export the maze and the discovered path to a JSON file,

*** Visually display the maze and the path in a web browser.


'.' represents an open path (white cell).
'#' represents a wall (black cell).
The start cell is green.
The end cell is red.
The path (if found) will be shown in blue .
